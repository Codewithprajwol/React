# React + Vite

--react offers one way data binding .....that means when our data updates then only our UI updates ....to update ui we have to update the data first....but in other frameworks like vue js and angular js ..it supports two way data binding which means when date upadates it automatically updates the UI.

---  In react we can only update state which leads to the ui update.
--- It is also called unidirectional Data flow.
---- by one way data binding we can make controlled inputs using states as main. 

--useRef
--- Actually what will happen is when using normal variable and using of Hook useRef doesnot acutally rerender the component but what is the use of useRef ......here, it doesnot re-render the component but it has the capability to hold the infromation of the previous state ... it can save the data of the pervious state and when the component re-renders then it give that stored value....whereas normal variable cannot do that.
