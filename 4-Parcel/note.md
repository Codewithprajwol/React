# Parcel, Babel , JSX
## so what is JSX?
### I am telling on what i have learnt till now... So, JSX is an javascript xml where we can write the code of the html in the javascript which is more readable and understandable than write long js and react code.

## Babel
### Babel is the advance Javascript tool...that converts the JSX code into the normal React code basically the react element.**React Element** is basically an object which can be created by using React.CreateElement.

1. The type of the element (e.g., a string like 'div' for a DOM element or a React component).
2. The props (properties) for the element.
3. The children (nested elements or text) of the element.

## Parcel
### Parcel is the zero configuartion build tool that works as a bundler.. which means it first convert the JSX code into the normal react code using babel as it uses it as dependencies.. and make it own dist folder and inside it make it's own file including our code and code form node modules and do import, export ... include all necessary code and bundle them, include source link with our code (so that we can do debugging properly and easily) and finally bundles them and start a server to display the output.
